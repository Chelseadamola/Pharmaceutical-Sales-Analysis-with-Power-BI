This repository contains my first Power BI project that provides a detailed analysis of pharmaceutical sales data, including yearly revenue, total transactions, total quantity, and revenue of managers. With visually appealing and easy-to-read charts and maps, this project makes it easy to gain insights into pharmaceutical sales data.

To ensure ease of navigation, this project includes next and previous pages, allowing for seamless transitions between different visualizations. Additionally, a mobile view is available for those who prefer to view the project on their Power BI app.

To use this Power BI project, simply download the PBIX file from the repository and open it in Power BI. Then, navigate to the relevant page by clicking on the next or previous button or selecting the page from the navigation pane.

I hope you find this Power BI project insightful and engaging! If you have any ideas or comment, please don't hesitate to share! I look forward to hearing from you.
